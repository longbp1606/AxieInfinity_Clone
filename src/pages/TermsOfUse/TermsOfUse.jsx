                                            <strong>Minting Digital Assets</strong>. By minting a Digital Asset as an NFT, you agree to comply with any terms, including licenses or payment rights that are embedded within or otherwise included with any such Digital Asset. Axie Infinity does not guarantee that Digital Assets will be transferable to or have any utility in connection with any other platform.

                                            <strong>Digital Asset Terms</strong>. There may be limits on or other terms applicable to the purchase, sale or use of Digital Assets or Items comprising Axie Infinity's Content (defined below), including, without limitation, any fee payable in connection with any subsequent sale of a Digital Asset or Item, regardless of whether such sale takes place on or through the Service (each such subsequent sale, a "<strong>Secondary Sale</strong>," and such fee, a "<strong>Secondary Sale Fee</strong>"), and Axie Infinity will display such terms at point of sale or otherwise within the Services (the limits and other terms, collectively, the "<strong>Digital Asset Terms</strong>").

                                            <strong>Transacting in Digital Assets</strong>. All transactions regarding Digital Assets are managed and confirmed on the Blockchain. You understand that your Blockchain public address may be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction. Axie Infinity is not and shall not be a party to any transaction or dispute between any initial minter of a Digital Asset (other than any Digital Asset that we mint) and any subsequent owner of such Digital Asset (unless we are the owner of such Digital Asset), whether arising from any rights granted in that Digital Asset or otherwise, unless otherwise set forth in connection with such Digital Asset.

                                            <strong>Game Rules</strong>. You may be able to use the Services to take certain actions in connection with one or more Digital Assets or Items that results in a swap, trade, or other exchange of that Digital Asset or Item for a modified, new, or otherwise different Digital Asset or Item (each, a "<strong>Play</strong>"). A Digital Asset or Item that you receive in connection with or as a result of a Play may have different traits than the Digital Asset or Item that you used in such Play, such as traits that represent different elements of rarity or "level" status. Axie Infinity does not represent that any Digital Asset or Item that you receive from a Play will have similar or equivalent attributes or value to the Digital Asset or Item that you originally used in such Play. Axie Infinity shall have no liability to you in connection with (i) any Digital Asset or Item that you use in a Play, or (ii) any Digital Asset or Item that you receive in connection with a Play. In some instances, a Play may result in a Digital Asset or Item being sent to a null address, erased, or otherwise rendered unusable ("<strong>Burned</strong>"), in each case in accordance with the then-current functionality of the Services and any in-game supplemental terms. Any action that results in such Digital Asset or Item being irrevocably modified or Burned is permanent and irreversible. You acknowledge and agree that Axie Infinity shall not be liable to you in connection with any Digital Asset or Item that is irrevocably modified and/or Burned as a result of or in connection with your use of the Services.

                                            <strong>Marketplace</strong>. Certain Digital Assets can be bought, sold, and traded with other users on the Axie Infinity marketplace ("<strong>Marketplace</strong>"). Pricing and payment terms on the Marketplace, including specific details relating to the offering of any Digital Assets, will be set forth at the point of sale. Axie Infinity may, in its sole discretion, limit the use of the Marketplace to the listing and sale of certain Digital Assets or collections of Digital Assets. Digital Assets listed on the Marketplace are being offered by the individuals seeking to sell such Digital Assets ("<strong>Sellers</strong>"), and the actual contracts for sale are between the Sellers and the individuals seeking to buy such Digital Assets ("<strong>Buyers</strong>"). A user who has purchased a Digital Asset on the Marketplace, whether in its initial sale or via Secondary Sale, may be able to resell that Digital Asset on the Marketplace and/or on a third-party marketplace, subject to these Terms of Use and any supplemental terms and conditions. Except where explicitly set forth at point of sale, Axie Infinity is not the Seller of any Digital Asset listed on the Marketplace and will not provide or deliver any Digital Assets. While we may, in our discretion, help facilitate resolution of Disputes through various programs, we have no control over the ability of Sellers to sell or receive compensation for Digital Assets, the ability of Buyers to purchase or pay for Digital Assets, or that a Buyer and Seller will actually complete a transaction on the Marketplace. While Axie Infinity may provide pricing and guidance for Digital Assets sold by Sellers on our Marketplace, such information is solely informational. We do not have control over the quality, safety, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any aspect whatsoever of any Digital Assets advertised or sold by Sellers, or of the integrity, responsibility, or any actions of any users. Axie Infinity makes no representations about any transactions or interactions, whether public, private, online or offline, including with regard to the suitability, reliability, timeliness or accuracy thereof.

                                            <strong>Selling on the Marketplace</strong>. PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR SELLING ON THE MARKETPLACE BEFORE USING THE MARKETPLACE. To help prevent the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Axie Infinity may ask you to provide additional information or copies of identifying documents that will allow us and/or our dApp Providers (defined below) to identify you. We reserve the right to require you to provide such additional information and documents. Failure to provide such information upon request, as well as any other violation of these Terms of Use, may result in your removal from the Services and/or a termination of your ability to sell, purchase or use Digital Assets via the Marketplace. By using the Marketplace to offer for sale or sell a Digital Asset, you hereby appoint Axie Infinity as your limited agent for the sole purpose of receiving, holding and settling payments due and owed to you arising out of the sale of Digital Assets through the Services. Subject to these Terms of Use, Axie Infinity will process such payments and settle payments that are actually received by Axie Infinity, less any amounts owed to Axie Infinity, including taxes, fees and other obligations as applicable. You agree that a payment received by Axie Infinity on your behalf satisfies the payor's obligation to make payment to you, regardless of whether Axie Infinity actually settles such payment to you. If Axie Infinity does not settle any such payments to you as described in these Terms of Use, you will have recourse only against Axie Infinity and not the payor, as payment is deemed made by the payor to you upon constructive or actual receipt by Axie Infinity.

Axie Infinity may, in its sole discretion, limit the use of the Axie Mavis Store to the listing and sale of certain Items only, and the availability of such Items is not guaranteed.

When you place an order on the Axie Mavis Store, we will send you a notification (e.g. in the form of a popup message) confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the "<strong>Order Confirmation</strong>"). The Order Confirmation is acknowledgement that we have received your order but is not an acceptance of your offer to enter into an agreement. If we accept your offer, we will conclude the transaction for an Item ordered by you, when we transfer or otherwise make available the Item to you and send you another notification indicating that we have transferred the Item or otherwise make available the Item to you. You hereby consent to receiving any and all sales invoices electronically.

If you are the then-current owner of any Digital Asset or Item, you are granted a limited license, subject to these Terms of Use, to create Fan Art from such Digital Asset or Item and to use such Fan Art for commercial purposes; provided that your revenue from Fan Art derived from such Digital Asset or Item must not exceed ten thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000), except subject to the execution of a separate commercial license agreement between you and Axie Infinity or otherwise indicated by us. Each Digital Asset or Item may embody or include certain artwork owned or created by Axie Infinity (the "<strong>Artwork</strong>"). You acknowledge and agree that Axie Infinity or our respective licensors owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Artwork, and all intellectual property rights therein. Digital Assets or Items may also embody or include one or more Marks (collectively with the Artwork embodied by such Digital Asset or Item, the "<strong>Visual IP</strong>"). The Visual IP is neither stored nor embedded in the Digital Assets or Item but is accessible through the Digital Assets or Items. ALTHOUGH EACH DIGITAL ASSET OR ITEM ITSELF IS OWNED BY ITS THEN-CURRENT OWNER, THE VISUAL IP EMBODIED THEREIN IS LICENSED, PURSUANT TO THESE DIGITAL ASSET AND ITEM TERMS, AND NOT TRANSFERRED OR SOLD, TO SUCH OWNER. The rights that you have in and to the Visual IP are limited to those expressly set forth in these Digital Asset and Item Terms. Axie Infinity and its licensors reserve all rights in and to the Visual IP not expressly granted to you herein. AXIE INFINITY PROVIDES EACH DIGITAL ASSET AND ITEM, LICENSES THE VISUAL IP TO THE THEN-CURRENT OWNER OF THE DIGITAL ASSET OR ITEM, AND PROVIDES THE SERVICES ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. AXIE INFINITY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE LICENSE TO CREATE AND DISPLAY THE VISUAL IP EMBODIED BY A DIGITAL ASSET OR ITEM IS AUTOMATICALLY AND ALWAYS TRANSFERRED WITH THE RESPECTIVE DIGITAL ASSET OR ITEM AS PROVIDED IN THESE DIGITAL ASSET AND ITEM TERMS. OTHERWISE, THE LICENSE TO DISPLAY THE VISUAL IP EMBODIED BY EACH DIGITAL ASSET OR ITEM IS NON-TRANSFERABLE. You acknowledge that the license granted to you in these Digital Asset and Item Terms applies only to the extent that you lawfully purchased or acquired a Digital Asset or Item and, with respect to any such Digital Asset or Item, for so long as you own such Digital Asset or Item. If at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Digital Asset or Item for any reason, the license granted in these Digital Asset and Item Terms will immediately terminate with respect to such Digital Asset or Item without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Visual IP embodied by such Digital Asset or Item. The license granted in these Digital Asset and Item Terms will also automatically terminate, with all rights returning to Axie Infinity, if: (a) you breach these Digital Asset and Item Terms or the Terms of Use, which shall include any unauthorized transfer or acquisition of a Digital Asset or Item; or (b) you engage in any unlawful business practice related to Digital Assets or Items. In the event that you did not lawfully purchase or acquire a Digital Asset or Item, or upon any termination of the license granted in these Digital Asset and Item Terms, Axie Infinity may disable your access to the Visual IP and/or deny you access to the Services and/or any further benefits, services, or goods associated with the Digital Asset or Item.

These restrictions will survive the expiration or termination of licenses granted hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, the license granted by these Terms of Use does not include: (a) the right to use the Visual IP in connection with additional digital assets or items; or (b) the right to create derivative works of the Visual IP. You may not use or attempt to register any asset (including, without limitation, any domain names, social media accounts, or related addresses) that contains or incorporates any Visual IP, or any other representation, name, or mark that may be confusingly similar to any of Axie Infinity's intellectual property.

You may not substitute any other currency, whether cryptocurrency or fiat currency, for the currency in which you have contracted to pay at the time of purchase.

If any services or products, or payments for any services or products, under this Agreement are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Axie Infinity, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Axie Infinity for any liability or expense Axie Infinity may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon Axie Infinity's request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, "Sales Tax" means any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.

                                            <strong>Informal Negotiations.</strong> To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a "<strong>Dispute</strong>" and collectively, the "<strong>Disputes</strong>") brought by either you or us (individually, a "<strong>Party</strong>" and collectively, the "<strong>Parties</strong>"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally and in good faith for at least the lesser of (i) the time necessary to resolve such Dispute or (ii) thirty (30) days before initiating the arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

                                            <strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> If a Party is unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Disputes (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitration compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all the arbitration fees and expenses. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration can take place in the Cayman Islands. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgement on the award entered by the arbitrator. If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in the Cayman Islands, sitting in Grand Cayman, and the Parties hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to Services be commenced more than one (1) year after the cause of the action arose. Each Party agrees that, if this provision is found to be unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed or jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

                                            <strong>Exceptions to the Informal Negotiations and Arbitration.</strong> The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provision concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, the intellectual property rights of a Party, (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. Each Party agrees that, if any portion of this provision is found to be unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction located in the Cayman Islands, sitting in Grand Cayman.

                                            The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile and may significantly fluctuate at any given moment for any reason, even becoming worthless. Due to these price fluctuations, you may gain or lose value in your digital assets at any given moment, and the fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your Digital Assets, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Digital Assets will not lose money.

                                            The Services do not store, send, or receive Digital Assets. This is because Digital Assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the applicable Digital Asset's supporting blockchain. Any transfer of Digital Assets occurs only on the supporting blockchain, and not on the Services.
                                        </li>

                                            The current regulatory regime(s) governing blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens, digital assets, and other crypto-based items and collectibles is uncertain and may be constantly changing. New regulations or policies may materially and adversely affect the Service and the value and utility of Digital Assets.

                                            There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain-based products, such as Digital Assets, Items, and cryptocurrencies, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Internet, Blockchains or any other blockchain, however caused.
                                        </li>

                                            Malicious individuals or organizations may target you and attempt to steal any Digital Assets and/or Items you may hold or claim any Digital Asset and/or Item that you may have purchased. You are solely responsible for protecting yourself against such actions.

                                            There is no technology that is completely secure or safe. You should therefore exercise caution when using any technology.

                                            We do not have ownership or control of the smart contracts deployed by third parties, and we are not responsible and make no guarantees regarding their capabilities, operation, or functionality. We do not control the public Blockchains that you are interacting with, and we do not control certain smart contracts that are integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible, and we have no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.
                                        </li>

                                            We are not responsible for losses or casualties due to developers' or representatives' delay or failure to report any issues with any Blockchain supporting Digital Assets, including without limitation, forks, technical node issues, or any other issues that result in losses of any sort.

                                            The Service relies on third-party platforms and vendors. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with these parties; if their respective terms and conditions or pricing changes; if we violate or cannot comply with these parties' terms and conditions; or if any of these parties loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service may be degraded.

                                            A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (including without limitation the Blockchains) could negatively impact the development of the Axie Infinity ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Digital Assets or Items.

                                            The legal and regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Axie Infinity ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Digital Assets.

These persons are often referred to colloquially as "whales". Whether acting individually or collectively, these whales may have significant impact, and may be able to influence or cause significant market events that may have a detrimental effect on price, value or functionality of Digital Assets or Items. Furthermore, these whales, or other network participants and users, may make decisions that are not in your best interest as an owner of Digital Assets or Items.

These items you purchase may be inaccessible on the Site or through the Service. You understand and accept that the inability to view items on the Site or the inability to use the Service in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on any blockchains does not give you any grounds for a claim against us.

If, as a result of the investigation, we believe that criminal activity may have occurred, we reserve the right to refer the matter to, and to cooperate with, any and all applicable legal authorities. We are entitled, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, to disclose any information or materials on or in the Services, including your Content, in Axie Infinity's possession in connection with your use of the Services, to (i) comply with applicable laws, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce these Terms of Use, (iii) respond to any claims that your Content violates the rights of third parties, (iv) respond to your requests for customer service, or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Axie Infinity, its users, or the public, and all law enforcement or other government officials, as Axie Infinity in its sole discretion believes to be necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these Terms of Use, you hereby provide your irrevocable consent to such monitoring. You acknowledge and agree that you have no expectation of privacy concerning your use of the Services, including without limitation text, voice, or video communications.

You agree to promptly notify Axie Infinity of any third-party Claims and cooperate with the Axie Infinity Parties in defending such Claims. You further agree that the Axie Infinity Parties shall have control of the defense or settlement of any third-party Claims. THIS INDEMNITY IS IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT IN LIEU OF, ANY OTHER INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND AXIE INFINITY.

                                        These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services, or with respect to the Services, constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. You may not assign these Terms of Use, or any of your rights or obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, and unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision will be construed in a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the Parties, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the Services. You agree that these Terms of Use will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. The communications between you and Axie Infinity may take place via electronic means, whether you visit the Services or send Axie Infinity e-mails, or whether Axie Infinity posts notices on the Services or communicates with you via e-mail. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Axie Infinity in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Axie Infinity provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were to be in writing. The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights, which may include without limitation the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act at 15 U.S.C. §7001 et seq. ("E-Sign") or any comparable law or rule of your jurisdiction. Except as otherwise set forth herein, these Terms do not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any individual or entity that is not a party to these Terms. All communications and notices made or given pursuant to these Terms must be made in the English language. If we provide a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the English language version of the Agreement will control if there is any conflict.
